# Welcome to MySqlBulkCopy #
Welcome to the webpage of MySqlBulkCopy. This is the frramework much same like SQLBulkCopy for SQL server.

## Usage ##
MySqlBulkCopy can be used to copy data from one table to another from your website/windows application. You do not need to create a file stream to upload the data to destination column. MySqlBulkCopy can be used with DataTable and DataReader to upload the data from one table to another.

You are free to use/modify/redistribute the MySqlBulkCopy in your personal and commercial applications.

It will be nice if you can notify the author by mail to keep track on the number of products that use this assembly.

**Watch out for more features in MySqlBulkCopy**

The following are planned for future releases:
  * Transaction Support
  * Upload using Array co ordinals
  * Auto Generate Mapping Column datatypes
  * Validate Mapping Columns in Mysql
  * Upload All tables from a dataset

**Join Hands for Development/Testing/Documenting**
