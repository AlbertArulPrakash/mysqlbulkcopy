# mysqlbulkcopy

MySqlBulkCopy was created to provide bulk copy capabilities for one of my project. This does not support all operations like Transactions or not proper error reporting. 

Recently MySqlConnector implemented a native version of bulk copy (MySqlBulkLoader) which can load data from files to tables. 
I might be updating transactions to this library later provided I allocate time to this library.

In case you like this library and want to contribute to this, do let me know
